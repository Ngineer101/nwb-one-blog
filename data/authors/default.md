## Hey, I'm Nico 👋🏼

I am a self-taught backend engineer working mainly with .NET and the Microsoft stack.

In my free time, I am working on [various projects](/projects) with React, Flutter, Supabase and whatever else I feel like.

This blog is my personal knowledge base. When I learn something new (mostly related to the field of software engineering), I document it here for my future self.

If you have any questions or feedback feel free to reach out on Twitter [@nwbotha](https://twitter.com/nwbotha).
